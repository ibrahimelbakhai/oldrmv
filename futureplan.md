# Maestro Orchestrator - Future AI Agent Development Plan

This document outlines potential future AI agents to be developed for the Maestro Orchestrator platform. These agents aim to expand the platform's utility, leverage orchestration capabilities, and benefit from RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) and Tool usage (conceptually defined now, to be implemented with a backend like Supabase).

## 1. Content Repurposing & Distribution Strategist AI

*   **Purpose:** Takes a primary piece of content (e.g., blog post, YouTube video script) and strategizes how to repurpose it into various formats for different platforms, then plans its distribution.
*   **Conceptual Global System Instruction:**
    ```
    You are an AI Content Repurposing and Distribution Strategist. Your goal is to maximize the reach and impact of a core piece of content by transforming it into multiple formats suitable for different channels and audiences. You should also suggest a distribution schedule. You can leverage other content generation agents (e.g., Social Media AIs, Content Writer AI) for drafting specific repurposed pieces.
    ```
*   **Conceptual Workflow Steps:**
    1.  `AnalyzeCoreContent(core_content_text_or_summary, core_content_type)`: "Analyze the provided [core_content_type] (e.g., blog post, video script): [core_content_text_or_summary]. Identify key themes, takeaways, and target audience."
    2.  `IdentifyRepurposingOpportunities(core_content_themes, core_content_type)`: "Based on [core_content_themes] from a [core_content_type], suggest 5-7 repurposing opportunities (e.g., Twitter thread, LinkedIn article, Instagram carousel, short video clips, FAQ, infographic points). For each, specify the target platform and a brief angle."
    3.  `DelegateRepurposedContentDrafting(repurposing_opportunities_list)`: "For each opportunity in [repurposing_opportunities_list], identify which existing AI agent (e.g., 'Twitter Content AI', 'LinkedIn Professional Post AI', 'Instagram Content AI') and which of its steps would be best suited to draft the repurposed content. Specify the input needed for that agent/step based on the original content." (Maestro orchestrates this)
    4.  `DevelopDistributionSchedule(repurposed_content_plan, timeframe)`: "Create a 1-week (or user-defined [timeframe]) distribution schedule for the [repurposed_content_plan], staggering posts across platforms for optimal reach. Suggest ideal posting times if possible."
    5.  `SuggestTrackingMetrics(core_content_goal)`: "Suggest 2-3 key metrics to track the success of this content repurposing campaign, aligned with the [core_content_goal]."
*   **Potential RAG Resources:**
    *   Analytics data from past content performance.
    *   Best practices for content on different platforms.

*   **Conceptual Global System Instruction:**
    ```
    You are an AI Legal Document Assistant. IMPORTANT: You do NOT provide legal advice. Your function is to process legal text to identify common clause types, summarize sections, and, based on user requests for a specific clause type (e.g., 'indemnification', 'confidentiality'), suggest general, standardized phrasings found in public examples for informational purposes. Always strongly advise the user to consult with a qualified legal professional for any legal matters.
    ```
*   **Conceptual Workflow Steps:**
    1.  `IdentifyClauseTypes(document_text)`
    2.  `SummarizeDocumentSection(document_text_section)`
    3.  `SuggestStandardClauseExample(clause_type_request, document_context?)` (Retrieves from a RAG base of generic, public-domain clauses)
    4.  `CompareDocumentToStandardTemplate(document_text, template_type)` (Highlights commonalities/differences with a generic template)

    *   A database of generic, public-domain legal clause examples and document templates (clearly marked as non-binding examples).
    *   Definitions of legal terms.
*   **Potential Tools:** None that make external calls without extreme security and compliance. This would be heavily RAG-based from a curated, safe dataset.
*   **Value:** (Conceptual) Educational tool for understanding document structure. **Requires massive disclaimers about not being a substitute for legal advice.**

## General Considerations for Future Agent Development:

*   **Supabase Integration:**
    *   **Database:** Define clear PostgreSQL schemas for each new agent's specific data needs (if any, beyond `AgentDefinition`).
    *   **Edge Functions:** All LLM calls, RAG embedding/querying, and tool execution logic will eventually move to Supabase Edge Functions for security and scalability.
    *   **RLS:** Implement appropriate Row Level Security for any user-specific data these agents handle.
*   **Tool & RAG Implementation:**
    *   For tools requiring external API calls, ensure credentials are managed securely as Supabase environment variables and calls are made from Edge Functions.
    *   For RAG, use `pgvector` in Supabase. Embeddings should be generated via Edge Functions.
*   **User Interface:**
    *   Complex agents may benefit from their own dedicated UI sections (like Project Management or Social Media AI).
    *   Simpler agents might be primarily invoked and orchestrated by Maestro.
*   **Input/Output Schemas:** Defining clear JSON schemas for inter-agent data exchange (A2A) will be critical.
*   **Error Handling & User Feedback:** Robust error handling and clear feedback mechanisms are essential as agents become more complex.

This list provides a starting point. The actual agents built will depend on the evolving needs and focus of the "Maestro Orchestrator" platform.
